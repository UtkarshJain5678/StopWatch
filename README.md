# StopWatch
This is Skill Test 1: Stopwatch

Here we have 3 buttons Start, Stop, Reset a timer to show current recorded time.. and a indicator that indicates second's position
In one second there is 6degrees

In the Start I have Disabled the Stop Button, as We cannot Stop already stopped Timer

On Click of Start:
  Timer Starts from current minute and second value (0th minute and 0th second at the very Start)
  On Start we Increase degrees by 6degrees/second, So that the Second Indicator shows correct position of the seconds
  On click of start we enable the STOP button and disbale the START button
  
On Click of Stop:
  Timer stops where ever it was.. then we can start timer again on click of Start Button
  On click we disable the STOP button and enable the START button  

On Click of Reset Button:
  Timer resets to 00:00 (0th minute and 0th second) and degree is alo set to the Initial position (i.e. 270deg).
  Timer is set to initial time, no matter timer is still on or Stopped
